# Class 01 Notes

## Introducton:

### What is HTML?
   * HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
   * HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages

### Structure of HTML:

* HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages

* Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and  closing tags.

* Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value,separated by an equals sign.

* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

<!--
Simple HTML Code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
-->

*************************************************************************

## Extra Markup :

#### DOCTYPE :
    
* The HTML Document Type : All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

#### HTML Comments:

* HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
<!-- Write your comments here -->

#### ID attribute:

* Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other  elements on the page.

<!-- <h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1> -->

#### Class attribute:

* The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

* Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

<!-- <p class="important admittance">Hours: 10:00 – 18:00
(No admittance after 17:30)</p> -->

#### Block Element:

* Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.

* Examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.

#### Inline Element:

* Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.

* Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.

* <div> block-elements : The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level   box.
 
* <iframe> An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

* src :The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.

* height : The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels.

* width : The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe in pixels.

* <meta> :The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.

* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

*************************************************************************************************************

## HTML5 Layout:

#### Headers & Footers:

<header> <footer>
* The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
●● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
●● A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

#### Navigation:

<nav>
* The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

#### Articles:

<article>
* The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

#### Section:

<section>
* The <section> element groups related content together, andvtypically each section would have its own heading.

#### Figures

<figure> <figcaption>
* It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

## Process & Design:

* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

#### Site maps:

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

#### wireframe:

* A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

* The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

#### Visual hierarchy :

* Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for:
* 
1. size
2. color
3. style
4. Images

* When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved:

1. Proximity
2. Closure
3. Continuance
4. White Space
5. Color
6. Borders

# JafaScript Introduction 

* JafaScript is a series of instructions that a coputer can follow to acheive a goal

*  JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

* JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

* JavaScript is easy to learn.
* 

#### JafaScript makes WebPages More interactive by:

1. Access Content
2. Modify Content
3. Program Rules
4. React to Events

* To approch writing a scriot, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out eash step needed to complete that task ( using flow chart)
* 

#### An expression evaluates into a single value, there are tow expressions :

1. Expression that assign a value to a variable
2. Expression that use two or more values to a return a single value


#### Functions:

* Function let us  group a sereies of statement together to perform specific task.

* To create a Function, give it a name and then write the statements needed to acheive its task inside the curly braces.

#### HTML  is a content Layer 

* This is where the content of the page lives 
* The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

#### CSS is a presentaion Layer

* The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.) 

#### JavaScript is Behavior Layer

* This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. 

#### PLACING THE SCRIPT IN THE PAGE 

* You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags

#### Statments :

* is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.


#### JavaScript Case Sensitive:

* JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW. 

#### Comments:

* to explain what your code does.They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

#### Variables:

* A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables

* A variable is a good name for this concept because the data storedin a variable can change (or vary)each time a script runs. 
  
  #### Data Type:
  
  1. String Data type
  2. Numeric Data type
  3. Boolean Data type


#### You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags
