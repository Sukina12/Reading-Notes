# HTML, CSS and JavaScript Together

## HTML  is a content Layer 

This is where the content of the page lives 
The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

## CSS is a presentaion Layer

The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.) 

## JavaScript is Behavior Layer

This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. 

## PLACING THE SCRIPT IN THE PAGE 

You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags

### Statments :

is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.


### JavaScript Case Sensitive:

JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW. 

### Comments:

to explain what your code does.They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

### Variables:

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables

A variable is a good name for this concept because the data storedin a variable can change (or vary)each time a script runs. 
  
  ### Data Type:
  1. String Data type
  2. Numeric Data type
  3. Boolean Data type
