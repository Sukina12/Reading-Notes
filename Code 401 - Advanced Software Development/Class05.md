# Class 05 summary :

### What is a Linked List ?

* A linked list : " a sequence of nodes that are connected to each other".
* It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence

* Types of Linked List:
  1. Singly linked list : refers to the number of references the node has. (there is only one reference)

  2. Doubly linked list : refers to there being two refernces within the node.(there is a reference to the next and previous node)

* Node : individual items or links . each node contain data for link.

### what even is Big O?

* Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

* Type of Big O in linked list :
  1. An O(1) function takes constant time ,which is to say that it doesnâ€™t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is.it  always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm.

  2. An O(n) function , the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
