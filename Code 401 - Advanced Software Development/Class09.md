* "A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows". 

* "Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database. Each column in a table holds a certain kind of data and a field stores the actual value of an attribute". 

* "The rows in the table represent a collection of related values of one object or entity. Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, and rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys". 

* "This data can be accessed in many different ways without reorganizing the database tables themselves".
