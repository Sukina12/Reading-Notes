# class 11 Summary :

## Event Driven Applications 

### Why is access control important?
  
   * "Because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource.This could translate to who can access and edit a particular file, what kinds of equipment can be used or who can access certain devices".

### Describe an application that would need access control:

   * "When a user is added to an access management system, system administrators use an automated provisioning system to set up permissions based on access control frameworks, job responsibilities and workflows.The best practice of least privilege restricts access to only resources that employees require to perform their immediate job functions".

### What is a role used for?

   * make the application more secure by denied anyone to see data he didn't need it.

### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

   1. Roles can be added easily.
   2. Role actions can modified easily and will updates for all users.
   3. Routes actions can be changed easily.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms:


| Term      |                                                          |
| -----------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization  | "a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features".   |
| Role Based Access Control  | " is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC)".  |  
|Capabilities  |"A capability is a token, ticket, or key that gives the possessor permission to access an entity or object in a computer system". |


### Event-Driven Programming in Node.js :

   * " Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision".

   * Event-Driven Programming concepts:
     1. "An Event Handler (callback function called when the event triggered)".
     2. "A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event".

   #### Object Oriented Programming & Event-Driven Programming:

   * "The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other".
