# Class 16 Summary :

## AWS: Cloud Servers :

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle :

  * "The Request-Response model is used extensively and it's not only applicable to web applications (such as using a     browser). In fact, it's also used in the communication between machines".
  * "HTTP is the most commonly used protocol for web applications and, since it could take up a whole book itself, we'll cover only the most important part here, explaining how it works".

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC :
  * "A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers".

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

  * "push changes or updates from one deployment environment to another. When setting up a website you will always have your live website, which is called the live environment or production environment".
  * "the process of packaging application files as an archive file and transferring them to a target application server".

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms :

| Term      |                                                          |
| -----------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server |  is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients" |
|Pub/Sub | enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers.  |
| WRRC | Web Request Response Cycle : The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers. |

### Virtual Machines :
  
   * "compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps".
   * Virtual Machines Maneger : it is type of software that allows us to run an operating system within another operating system.

### VMS and the Cloud :

  * Virtualization : is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware.

  * hypervisor : is a program for creating and running virtual machines. 

  * A virtual machine : is the emulated equivalent of a computer system that runs on top of another system.

### AWS EC2 :

  * "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment".

### Elastic Beanstalk :

  * "is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS". 

  * Benefits:
    1. Fast and simple to begin.
    2. Impossible to outgrow.
    3. Developer productivity.
    4. Complete resource control.
