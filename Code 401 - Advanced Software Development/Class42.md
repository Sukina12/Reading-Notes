# Class 42 Summary :

##  Ethics ::

### Ethics In The Workplace::
  * "Workplace ethics refers to the way employees in an organization govern themselves and their overall work attitude, but it can also refer to the morality, or lack thereof, permeating a workplace".

  * "Workplace ethics can be divided into two larger areas of effort: how an employee governs themselves within the workplace, and how the organization conducts itself both internally and externally. Both have a tremendous effect on employee morale, performance, loyalty, job turnover, and work ethic itself". 

  * "I would be though, proud of being on a team and working with the employees that have decided to take a stand when calling out these wrongs. That's something that I would be looking for of my fellow employees when joining a team".

### Tech Company Principles :: 
  * "AI is computer programming that learns and adapts. It can’t solve every problem, but its potential to improve our lives is profound. At Google, we use AI to make products more useful—from email that’s spam-free and easier to compose, to a digital assistant you can speak to naturally, to photos that pop the fun stuff out for you to enjoy".
  * that AI should:
     1. Be socially beneficial
     2. Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.
     3. Be built and tested for safety.
     4. Be accountable to people
     5. Incorporate privacy design principles.
     6. Uphold high standards of scientific excellence.
     7. Be made available for uses that accord with these principles.

### Ethics in Technology ::
  * "Technology ethics is the application of ethical thinking to the practical concerns of technology. The reason technology ethics is growing in prominence is that new technologies give us more power to act, which means that we have to make choices we didn't have to make before".
