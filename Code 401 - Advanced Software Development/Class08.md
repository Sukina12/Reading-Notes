# Class 08 Summary :

### Access Control (ACL) :

### When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization? 
  * Basic : to ensure correct login information, handling encoded informationpassed from client to   server.
  * Bearer : grant user access only if the user has a token.

### What does the JSON Web Token package do?
  * " is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed".

### What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
  * Use environment variables.
  * Encryptions should be used to store those secretes within .git repositories
  * Donâ€™t store them in .git repositories

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms :


| Term      |                                                          |
| -----------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| encryption |  the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.  |
| token | coded string used to securely transfer information over the web.  |  
| bearer  | is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources  |
| secret  | Secret refers to a secret key or passcode that is used by a user to login, or create a login.  |
| JSON Web Token   | is an open standard  that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.   |


### RBAC : 
  * " role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC)".
  
  * Three primary rules are defined for RBAC: 
    1. Role assignment
    2. Role authorization
    3. Permission authorization

  * 5 steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC) :
    1. Inventory your systems
    2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
    3. Assign people to roles
    4. Never make one-off changes
    5.  Audit
