# Class 41 Summary:

## React Native :

### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks” :
  
  * "Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. Redux Toolkit’s goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux".

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

  * "easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience. It can be added at the start of a new project, or used as part of an incremental migration in an existing project".


### Document the following Vocabulary Terms :  

| Term      |                                                   |
| -----------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------|
|redux toolkit slices |Redux slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of application. Redux state is typically organized into slices, defined by the reducers that are passed to combineReducers |
|namespace |a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified|

### React Native:

#### What is React Native?

  * "React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use React's framework along with native platform capabilities".

  * "React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks".

#### Why is React Native?

  1. With React Native Framework, you can render UI for both iOS and Android platforms.

  2. It is an open source framework, which could be compatible with other platforms like Windows or tvOS in the near future.

  3. Since React Native components have the counterpart rights, you can reuse these components for building both Android and iOS apps.

  4. You can either incorporate REACT Native components into the code of existing app or reuse the Cordova-based code with the help of the plugin as well. However, your existing app must be built with Cordova and Ionic code.

  5. React Native Development is comparatively simple, quick and efficient.

  6. REACT Native is a great pick for those developers who have expertise in JavaScript as there is no need to learn Android specific Java or iOS’s Swift. React Native is a UI focused, which makes the apps load quickly and gives a smoother feel.

  7. Another reason why the REACT Native framework has gained popularity in recent years is that the framework helps cater both the platforms at one go and ends the holy war of selecting either iOS or Android development for mobile developers. Hence, giant companies like Facebook, Instagram, Skype, Airbnb, Tesla, Walmart, Baidu Mobile, Bloomberg, UberEATS Vogue and many more have shifted their eyeballs towards it.

### What's the difference between state and props in React?

  * "In a React component, the props are the variables that we pass from a parent component to a child component. Similarly, the state are also variables, with the difference that they are not passed as parameters, but rather that the component initializes and manages them internally".

#### Introduction to Expo:

  * Expo : "is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase".
  
#### Ejecting to ExpoKit:

  * "ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init".
