# Class 09 Summary:

### Functional Programming in Javascript:

* Functional Programming : is functional programming using to structure the code and the components . take arguments as input and then show output.

* Pure Function : Functions when take the same arguments return the same output . and the function application has no side effects.

* Pure Function Benefits :
1. testable.
2. produce the same result if send the same arguments.
3. make refactoring code much easier.

* immutability: not change by time and we can't  change it after created it. you can create new object with new value.

*  Referential transparency : term used in functional programming, means to give the function and the input value and get the same output. No external state used in the function.

### Node.js:

* Module: simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files. Includes three types: (core, local and third party).

* require : is a built-in function with a special purpose (to load modules).

* we use (module.export) to make it a vailable to other files. return the module use (require (./)).
