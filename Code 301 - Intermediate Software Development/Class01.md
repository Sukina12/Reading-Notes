# Class 01 Notes

### Intro To React

* ReactJS offers graceful solutions to some of front-end programmingâ€™s most persistent issues, allowing you to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease.

* React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible library for building user interfaces.

* Components :complex ULs from small pieces of code. we use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. React will update and re-render the components when the data change.

* In JavaScript classes, we need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.
