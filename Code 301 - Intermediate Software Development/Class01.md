# Class 01 Notes

### Intro To React

* ReactJS offers graceful solutions to some of front-end programming’s most persistent issues, allowing you to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease.

* React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible library for building user interfaces.

* Components :complex ULs from small pieces of code. we use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. React will update and re-render the components when the data change.

* In JavaScript classes, we need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.

### Hello World (React Example)

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);


### Introducing JSX :

##### Why JSX?

* React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

* Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. 

* We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.

##### Specifying Attributes with JSX :

* we use quotes to specify string literals as attributes :

* example : const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;

* also we can use curly braces to embed a javaScript expression in an attribute:

* example: const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;

### Rendering Elements:

* Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

* the element describes what you want to see on the screen.

* React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create.

* DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

* To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render().


* React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes.

* React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.


### Components and Props:

* Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

##### Function and Class Components:

* The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function

* example: function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
    }

* props : single object contain the JSX attribute and children of the user defined component.

##### Composing Components:

* Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

* when you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.

* All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
