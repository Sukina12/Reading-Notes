# Introducing CSS

### CSS to make web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS.

### CSS is an invisible box around every HTML element

### CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

### Examples Of Style:

1. Boxes 
   * Width and height
   * Borders color, width, and style
   * Background color and images
   * Position in the browser window

2. Text
  * Typeface
  * Size
  * Color
  * Italics, bold, uppercase,
  * lowercase, small-caps

3. Specific
   There are also specific ways in which you can style certain
  elements such as lists, tables, and forms

### CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

### CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

### Using External CSS:
   example:
   <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css"
    rel="stylesheet" />

### Using Internal CSS:
  example":
  <head>
<title>Using Internal CSS</title>
<style type="text/css">
body {
font-family: arial;
background-color: rgb(185,179,175);}
h1 {
color: rgb(255,255,255);}
</style>
</head>

### Declarations are made up of two parts: 
the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. 
For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
