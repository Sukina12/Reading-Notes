# Opertators And Loops

### comparision Operators:

#### Evaluating Conditions:
 
 evaluate Situation By comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. the result will be Boolean : true or false

 ##### examples:
 == is equal to
 != is not equal to
 === strict equal to
 !== strict not equal to
 > greater than
 < less than
 >= greater than or equal to
 <= less than or equal to

#### Logical OPerators:
 
 allow you to compare the results of more than one comparision operator>

 && Logical And
 || Logical Or
 !  Logical Not

#### Loops:
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run.
the condition will be checked again , it repeats until the condition return a false.
##### example :

for (var i=0; i<10; i++>)
{document.write(i);}

#### While Loop:

##### example:
var i = l ;
var msg = ' ' ;
II Set counter to 1
II Message
II Store 5 times tabl e in a variable
while (i < 10) {
msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br I>';
i++;
document .getEl ementByid( ' answer') . innerHTML = msg;


This loop will continue to runfor as long as the condition in the parentheses is true. 
That condition is a counter indicating that, as long as the variable i remains less than 10, the statements in the subsequent code block should run.
